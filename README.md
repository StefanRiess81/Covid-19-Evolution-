### This project has been chosen to evaluate and monitor the current ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic. The original Data has been provided by Our World in Data 

### The Original Datasource can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

### The Objective of this self created Project was to train and practise Coding Skill in Python, create Visuals in Tableau and to prepare Dashboards and Portfolios. 
### I choose the Covid-19 Pandemic as a Dataproject because i find the current Situation and how it is evolving very interesting. Checking on the Progress and how different Countries fight against the pandemic, like adding or removing restrictions, taking whole cities under lockdown by following a 0 Covid Strategie or how recent changes in Politics and tactis changed the Positive Caserate. All this is very interesting in the way humanity has to learn toi live with Covid 19.

### 3.How is the Covid-19 Disease evolving. 
### 4.Can we expect to "defeat" the Covid-19 Virus ?
